# DGTD
DGTD (thin-wire).
This project is built to share my code. I hope it may inspire some ideas.

'model_Wire_Mesh2.m' is a matlab version code, it can generate the wire parameters for my DGTD (thin-wire) program. I know it may not be beatiful. I choose this way because it is convinient for my team partners to use my program. They can write the parameters text with a form easy to study.
