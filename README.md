# DGTD
DGTD (thin-wire).
This project is built to share my code. Comments are welcomed.

'model_Wire_Mesh2.m' is a matlab code, it can generate a wire parameters for my DGTD (thin-wire) program. I know the code may not be beatiful. But it is convinient for my team partners to use my program. They can write a parameters text with low learning cost.
