# DGTD
DGTD (thin-wire)
This project is built for free, we can commnicate here to generate some ideas.
model_Wire_Mesh2.m is a matlab code, it can generate the wire parameters  for my DGTD (thin-wire) program. I know it may not be beatiful. I choose this way because it is convinient for my partners to use my program. They can write the parameters with a form easy to study.
