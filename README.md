# DGTD
DGTD (thin-wire).
This project is built to share my code for inspiration

'model_Wire_Mesh2.m' is a matlab code, it can generate a wire parameters for my DGTD (thin-wire) program. I know the code may not be beatiful. I choose this way because it is convinient for my team partners to use my program. They can write a parameters text with low learning cost. By the way, i'm not a very good programmer. Please forgive that.
